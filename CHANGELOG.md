## [1.1.0] (2025-01-31)

#### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes (Android Only)
-   **Upgraded Glide from 4.12.0 to 4.16.0** which may cause duplicate class conflicts if another package in your project also includes Glide.
  
If you encounter a build error stating `com.bumptech.glide.GeneratedAppGlideModuleImpl is defined multiple times` it means another package in your project is also bundling Glide.

To resolve this check the error message for the conflicting package and remove it if not needed.

Alternatively ensure all dependencies use the same Glide version by adding the following to your android/app/build.gradle file:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.16.0'
}
```

This helps save bandwidth by bundling assets you know is gonna be used in your current version. To enable this just pass `hybridAssets` as `true` and provide a `cloudUrl`. If using Firebase, the component will automatically handle `%2F` replacements and trailing ?alt=media removal in the URL. Refer to the documentation for more details.
